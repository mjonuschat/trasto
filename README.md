# Trasto

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/yabawock/trasto.png)](http://travis-ci.org/yabawock/trasto)

Translatable columns for Rails 3, directly stored in a postgres hstore in the model table.

Inspired by Barsoom's [traco](https://github.com/barsoom/traco/).

To store translations outside the model, see Sven Fuchs' [globalize3](https://github.com/svenfuchs/globalize3).

## Usage

Say you want `Post#title` and `Post#body` to support both English and Swedish values.

Write a migration to get hstore database columns with i18n suffixes, e.g. `title_i18n` and `body_i18n`, like:

    class CreatePosts < ActiveRecord::Migration
      def change
        create_table :posts do |t|
          t.hstore :title_i18n
          t.hstore :body_i18n

          t.timestamps
        end
      end
    end

Don't create `title` or `body` columns without the `_i18n` suffix, Trasto will define a method with that name.

Declare these columns in the model:

    class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
      translates :title, :body
    end

You can still use your accessors for `title_i18n` and `title_i18=` in forms, validations and other code, but you also get:

`#title`:  Shows the title in the current locale. If blank, falls back to default locale, then to any locale.

`#title=`: Assigns the title to the column for the current locale, if present.

`.locales_for_column(:title)`: Returns an array like `[:de, :en]` sorted with default locale first and then all currently available locals sorted alphabetically.

## Installation

Add this to your `Gemfile` if you use Bundler 1.1+:

    gem 'trasto'

If you're using Rails 3, add the following gem:

    gem 'activerecord-postgres-hstore'

Hstore support comes out of the box in Rails 4. Then run

    bundle install

to install it.


## Running the tests

    bundle
    rake
